## Idea For Assignment 1

The idea for my Assignment 1 is to create a dynamic and responsive website that allows users to make their KFC order with ease.

### External User’s Goal:

The site’s users are teenagers, young adults, families, regular and potential KFC customers who wishes to make KFC orders through their electronic devices.

### Site Owner’s goal:

KFC would like to have a website that can advertise their ongoing promotions well and allow users to use their website to order dine in, takeaway or delivery.

## Design Process:

As a user, I would like to use the KFC website on split screen, however, certain pages in the official KFC website is not responsive and i struggle navigating the website (E.g. Home Page and Menu Page are Not responsive). Hence I decided to make my KFC website responsive

As a user, I want the website to remember my cart even after I close my browser, so I decided to utilise local storage to store cart details.

As a user, I want to see a consistent use of color and design in the KFC Website. Thus, I decided to incorporate KFC's signature "Pigment Red" colour into every page.
